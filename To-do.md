## Pairwise T-test results for Assessment 74179: Ability Estimates 


Interpreting Pairwise t-Test Results
Looking at your pairwise t-test table with Bonferroni correction and your visualization of model results, I can provide a detailed interpretation of these post-hoc comparisons.
Key Findings from the Pairwise Comparisons

Despite the overall ANOVA showing no significant differences among models (p = 0.419), the pairwise tests reveal some specific model pairs that do differ significantly:
Significant Differences (p < 0.05):

MHM shows the most differences from other models:
MHM vs. Common.K (p = 7.1e-05)
MHM vs. DLCSL (p = 0.00253)
MHM vs. DLCTL (p = 0.03666)
MHM vs. GoMRT (p = 0.00046)
MHM vs. ILCRE (p = 5.3e-06)
MHM vs. ILCRI (p = 6.3e-08)
MHM vs. Normative (p = 5.8e-08)
MHM vs. VICS (p = 1.2e-07)
MHM vs. VII (p = 1.5e-06)
ILCRE differs from:
ILCRE vs. DLCSL (p = 9.1e-05)
ILCRE vs. DLCTL (p = 6.6e-05)
ILCRE vs. GoMRT (p = 0.00236)
ILCRI differs from:
ILCRI vs. DLCSL (p = 0.00029)
ILCRI vs. DLCTL (p = 0.00090)
ILCRI vs. GoMRT (p = 0.00051)
ILCRI vs. Normative (p = 0.01105)
ILCRI vs. VICS (p = 0.00786)
No Significant Differences (p > 0.05):

Common.K, DLCSL, DLCTL, GoMRT, VICS, and VII show no significant differences between any pairs within this group (all p = 1.00000)
ILCRE vs. ILCRI show no significant difference (p = 1.00000)
Normative vs. VICS and Normative vs. VII show no significant differences
Visual Confirmation in Your Plots

Looking at your visualization:
MHM stands out: Your MHM plot shows a noticeably different pattern of D values (brown bars) compared to other models, which explains why it differs significantly from all other models.
ILCRE and ILCRI differences: While the overall patterns look similar, these models must have subtle but statistically significant differences in their parameter estimates compared to some other models.
Core similar models: Your Common K, DLCSL, DLCTL, GoMRT, VICS, and VII models show extremely similar patterns in the visualization, confirming the non-significant differences in the pairwise comparisons.
Practical Implications

Model Grouping:
Group 1 (Core Models): Common.K, DLCSL, DLCTL, GoMRT, VICS, and VII are statistically indistinguishable
Group 2: ILCRE and ILCRI form another group
Group 3: MHM stands alone as distinctly different
Model Selection:
Within Group 1, you can select any model based on non-statistical criteria (simplicity, computational efficiency)
The MHM model produces significantly different results and should be considered separately
ILCRE and ILCRI show some differences from other models but are similar to each other
Reporting Recommendation:
Report that most models produce statistically equivalent results
Highlight MHM as producing significantly different parameter estimates
Note that the Bonferroni correction is conservative, so these differences are likely meaningful
This pattern of results suggests that while your models generally produce similar results, the MHM model and to some extent the ILCRE and ILCRI models capture something different in your data. This could be valuable information for understanding the underlying processes you're studying.



## Pairwise T-test results: Item Estimates 

MHM Model Shows Distinct Parameter Estimates

The MHM model stands out significantly from all other models with extremely small p-values (ranging from 5.3e-08 to 1.4e-09). This indicates that the item parameters estimated by MHM are statistically different from every other model in your comparison. This suggests that MHM is capturing item characteristics in a fundamentally different way than the other models.
Normative Model Shows Moderate Distinctiveness

The Normative model differs significantly from several other models:
Different from Common.K (p = 0.036)
Different from GoMRT (p = 0.019)
Strongly different from ILCRE (p = 9.4e-05)
Different from VII (p = 0.044)
However, it shows no significant differences from DLCSL, DLCTL, ILCRI, and VICS (all p > 0.05).
ILCRI and ILCRE Show Differences

These two models differ significantly from each other (p = 0.0052), suggesting they estimate item parameters differently despite possibly having similar names or theoretical foundations.
Core Group of Statistically Equivalent Models

Common.K, DLCSL, DLCTL, GoMRT, VICS, and VII show no significant differences among themselves (most p-values = 1.00). This suggests these models produce statistically equivalent item parameter estimates despite their theoretical or structural differences.
Practical Implications

For item parameter estimation, the choice among Common.K, DLCSL, DLCTL, GoMRT, VICS, and VII would not significantly impact the results.
The MHM model produces significantly different item parameter estimates and should be considered separately when interpreting results or making measurement decisions.
When comparing results across studies that used different models, it would be important to note whether MHM or one of the more similar models was used, as this could affect comparability.
The finding that theoretically different models often produce statistically equivalent item parameters suggests a degree of robustness in the item parameter estimation process across different psychometric frameworks.
